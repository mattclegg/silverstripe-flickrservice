|       FINDING THE GROUP ID       |
+----------------------------------+
If you want to find the groups ID, browse to the group page (e.g. http://www.flickr.com/groups/facesinplaces).
- If you're not yet part of the group, right click the 'Join this group' text on the right and select 'Properties'.
- Otherwise, if you're a part of the group already, right click the 'Invite' link at the top (just under the group name) and select 'Properties'.

- Copy the part out of the Address/URL field after the last '=' sign. (It will be something like 377682@N20)
- Paste this into the Group ID field in the CMS.
